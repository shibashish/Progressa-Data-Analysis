# Progressa-Data-Analysis

I will be using data from the [Progresa program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades), a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper "[School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387803001858)", by Paul Shultz.

The goal is to implement some of the basic econometric techniques to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates. The timeline of the program was:

 * Baseline survey conducted in 1997
 * Intervention begins in 1998, "Wave 1" of data collected in 1998
 * "Wave 2 of data" collected in 1999
 * Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point the control villages were treated.
